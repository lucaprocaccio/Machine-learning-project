# Machine-learning-project
 Taxonomy prediction. Project for Machine Learning CourseS2021 (MSc Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics).

The aim of the project is try to use codon frequencies from different organisms to classify them into their kingdom. In this homework are exploited different methods for clustering, regression and classification. The performance of each one of these methods is then evaluated.

GitHub has some troubles with rendering the notebook. The notebook can be viewed at this link [notebook_viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/lucaprocaccio/Machine-learning-project/blob/main/Procaccio_Luca_969019.ipynb).
